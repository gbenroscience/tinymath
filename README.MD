**tinymath** is a lean, fast and efficient math parser written in native C for maximum speed.
It has, inbuilt into it, the ability to do expression parsing, variables arithmetic, trigonometric computations, functions creation and evaluation, derivatives evaluation and computation and statistics.

### Expression parsing:
2+2\
4+3*2-5^(3+sin(7))\

### Variables:
$$
a11=5.2;b13=3.8;
sin(a11-4*b13);
$$
